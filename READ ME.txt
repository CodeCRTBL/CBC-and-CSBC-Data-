This text serves as a guide text for running the source code of the manuscript. 

In the source code folder you will find the following: 

Source code Folder 
* It contains the 4 major python file together with csv and pkl files to make it work.
* * HCT116Act.ipynb
  * This source code entails the loading of the main dataset from ChEMBL, the cleaning and generation of molecular fingerprints and profiles, and images. It also include the counting procedures of CBC and CSBC ML.
 
* * BitFreqCounting.ipynb
  * This source code entails the bit frequency counting for both CBC and CSBC. Although, the counting is partially done with HCT116Act.ipynb, the full analysis is done in this code. Notice that here everything is re run to check the precision and accuracy of the process.

* * CSBC-CBC_ML.ipynb
  * This source code entails the creation and development of CSBC and CBC ML. This focuses on the testing, training and validaiton of the model. All of the major results of the manuscript are derived from here.
 
* * Machine Structural Perception.ipynb
  * This contains the visualization of the molecular fingerprints, profiles, and machine perception of a structural query. Essentially, this is dedicated to understand how does the developed ML algorithm perceived the structural motif, position and neighbors effects on the target bioactvity. 


Note: All of the pkl files is also saved in the source folder so that the code will run successfully. In addition, take note that some packages must be download with your python to make code run. For reference see the import section of the jupyter notebook.
