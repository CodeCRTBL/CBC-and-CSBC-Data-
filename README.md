# CBC-and-CSBC-Data-

Raw Data Folder 
* Contains the database of molecules downloaded from ChEMBl, raw data of all the statistical, numerical simulations and machine learning outputs. In addition, it entails the morgan profiles of each molecule generated from Morgan Finger Printing.

Images Folder 
* Contains 6304 images of the dataset molecule and the significant bits were highlighted with grey color. It was used by the researchers for the purpose of visualizing the motif, position and neighbor of the significant bits in a specific molecule of interest.

Figures Folder 
* Contains the supporting figures generated from the study which are also important but not included in the paper.
